# wifi-adapter

This is all adapted from a post on a raspberrypi.org forum by user SurferTim (the link of which can be found [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=203087)). 

To start using your Raspberry Pi as a wifi adapter (say for a device that doesn't have wireless capabilities), simply clone this repository and run ```./wifi-bridge.sh```. Reboot the Pi and you should be good to go.
